		<hr>
		<p>Brulgwyn furrows his brow, staring at the <b>crude drawing</b> of the <b>Root of Withering</b>
 before looking back at Eldrin. <b>"Tell me about Black Hollow. What am I walking
 into?"</b></p>
		<p>Eldrin exhales slowly, placing a hand on the <b>dusty tome</b>. “Black Hollow was once a
 prosperous dwarven settlement, built deep within the <b>ashen cliffs</b> far to the north. Its
 halls were carved into the mountain itself, rich with ore and dwarven craft.”</p>
		<p>He pauses, his expression darkening. “But something happened. The records are
 unclear, but the settlement was abandoned <b>centuries ago</b>, its name erased from
 most dwarven histories. The only stories that remain speak of <b>shadows creeping through the halls, voices whispering in the dark</b>… and a <b>great calamity</b> that
 befell its people.”</p>
		<p> He taps a finger on the <b>Root of Withering’s illustration</b>. “If this artifact is there,
 someone must have unearthed it. And whoever did… may have unleashed the curse upon your village.”</p>
		<p> Eldrin folds his arms. “Black Hollow is not a place for the weak-hearted. You will face
 more than just old stone and dust. The past is restless there.”</p>
<p>Brulgwyn crosses his arms, his expression unwavering. <b>“If the past is restless, I
 need to know what I’m walking into. What dangers lurk in Black Hollow?”</b>
 Eldrin’s gaze sharpens, and he steps closer to the flickering brazier. The green embers
 cast eerie shadows across his face as he speaks.</p>
<p><b>“The first danger is the land itself.</b>” He waves a hand, and the fire crackles,
 shifting into the shape of jagged cliffs and a ruined city. <b>"Black Hollow lies deep in
 the northern mountains, where the winds howl like the dead. Few roads lead there, and those that do are treacherous. Avalanches, sheer drops, and
 frozen tunnels will be your first test."</b></p>
<p> The flames flicker again, reshaping into <b>twisted, shadowy figures.</b></p>
		<p><b>“But worse still are the spirits.”</b></p>
		<p>Eldrin’s voice lowers. <b>“Something unnatural happened in Black Hollow. The
 dwarves who lived there did not simply vanish—they linger. Shades of the
 past, trapped between worlds, bound by sorrow and rage. If they sense your
 presence, they may not let you leave.”</b></p>
		<p> The fire shifts once more, revealing <b>a massive, slithering shape</b> in the depths of
 the ruins.</p>
		<p> <b>“And then… there are the deeper things.”</b> Eldrin’s voice grows grim. “The
 calamity that befell Black Hollow was not the work of mere men. Some say the
 settlement uncovered something beneath the stone<b>—a darkness that should have
 remained buried.</b> If the Root of Withering is tied to this, then whatever lies beneath
 may <b>still</b> be waiting.”</p>
		<p> He lets the fire die down, turning back to Brulgwyn. “So I ask you, warrior<b>—do you
 still intend to go?”</b></p>
		<p>Brulgwyn crosses his arms, his brow furrowed in thought. <b>“If this curse is ancient,
 surely there must be another way to break it. Could a powerful healer, cleric,
 or wizard undo its effects?”</b></p>
		<p> Eldrin strokes his beard, considering the question. “A powerful enough <b>divine healer</b>
 or <b>arcane master</b> might be able to cleanse the curse… but such magic is rare, and
 the deeper the corruption, the harder it is to undo. If the Root of Withering is truly the
 source, then simply healing the sick might not be enough—it must be destroyed, or
 the curse could return.”</p>
		<p>He taps his fingers on the wooden table. “However… there <b>may</b> be one who could
 help.”</p>
		<p> He turns to another shelf, pulling free <b>a faded map</b> and tracing a path with his finger.
 “Deep within the <b>Emerald Vale</b>, past the silver rivers, dwells an ancient healer<b>—Lady
 Vaelora, the Last Light</b>. She is said to wield magic strong enough to cleanse <b>even
 the blackest corruption.”</b></p>
		<p> Eldrin looks back at Brulgwyn. “The journey is perilous. The <b>Vale is shrouded in
 enchantments,</b> and many who seek it never return. But if you wish to find another
 path, seeking <b>Lady Vaelora</b> may be your best hope.”</p>

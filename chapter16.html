			<h1>CHAPTER 16</h1>
			<h2>The Tunnel</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn tightens his grip on the <b>Shield of Protection,</b> the familiar weight of
 responsibility heavy on his shoulders. The runes along the walls throb like a heartbeat
 as he steps forward, casting shadows that seem to shift and twitch unnaturally.</p>
			
			<p>As he moves deeper into the passage, the tunnel opens into a vast <b>underground
 sanctum.</b> The glow intensifies, revealing a grand chamber carved into the stone with
 masterful dwarven craftsmanship. At its center is a <b>crystalline basin,</b> pulsing with
 radiant blue light. Suspended above it is a vine-wrapped artifact—the <b>true Root of
 Withering,</b> uncorrupted.</p>
			
			<p> But you’re not alone.</p>
			
			<p> Across the chamber, a <b>withered dwarf-shaped figure</b> emerges from the dark. Its
 body is tangled with rot and vine, its eyes glowing with greenish decay. It speaks in a
 guttural, echoing voice:</p>
			
			<p><b>"You seek to cure them... but the root binds us all. Will you rip it from the
 earth and break what remains?"</b></p>
			
<p>It raises a hand, and the light in the chamber flickers. The air grows colder.</p>
	
<p>Brulgwyn narrows his eyes, focusing on the creature’s words, body
 language, and the unnatural way its presence disrupts the sanctum. You rolled for
 <b>Insight</b> to sense its true intent.</p>
			
			<p>With an <b>Insight check of 16,</b> Brulgwyn studies the strange creature intently—the
 way its elongated fingers twitch, the hollow resonance of its voice, the slight tremble
 when it speaks of "exchange."</p>
			
			<p>He senses <b>hesitation,</b> maybe even <b>fear.</b> Whatever this being is, it <b>doesn't want
 conflict.</b> It's <b>bound</b> to this place, a remnant or guardian of ancient magic, and the
 offer it presents is real<b>—but not without cost.</b></p>
			
			<p> The exchange it speaks of is likely <b>a trial of will, spirit, or memory—</b>not just a
 transaction. It’s testing Brulgwyn’s resolve, measuring whether his desire to save his
 people is stronger than his fear, his past, or his doubts.</p>
			
			<p> The creature leans closer and speaks once more in a whisper:</p>
			
			<p><b> "Then step forward, bearer of burden. To claim the cure, offer your truth.
 One memory, one vow, one sacrifice. Do you accept?"</b></p>
			
			<p>The moment Brulgwyn utters, <b>“Yes, I accept,”</b> a hush falls over the chamber. The
 glowing passage behind him dims, and a pale, silver-blue light envelops the creature.
 Its many eyes shimmer, and the sigils on the walls ignite with ancient dwarven runes.</p>
			
			<p>The creature raises one hand, and three ghostly images swirl into being before
 Brulgwyn:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li> <b>A memory —</b> Brulgwyn’s childhood home, nestled deep in the mountains, the
 faces of his kin warm and alive before the sickness claimed them.</li><br>
				<li> <b>A vow —</b> The moment he stood before his village elders, swearing to find a cure
 or die trying.</li><br>
				<li> <b>A sacrifice —</b> A vision of Brulgwyn’s own vitality, strength slowly fading, as if
 aging years in moments.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The creature speaks:</p>
			
			<p> <b>“The path to the cure lies ahead, but the door will only open with one of
 these:</b></p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li> <b>Relinquish a cherished memory.</b></li>
			<li> <b>Forsake your vow and take a new path.</b></li>
			<li><b>Surrender a portion of your life force.”</b></li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><b>“Choose, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch… What will you give?”</b></p>
			
			<p> Brulgwyn steadies himself before the ancient spirit, its form flickering like a memory
 wrapped in mist and light. He speaks with careful words, trying to mask his deeper
 intentions beneath a veil of calm sincerity.</p>
			
			<p> The spirit’s expression flickers—not angered, but not entirely convinced either.</p>
			
			<p><i> ““You speak with purpose… but your words lack the weight of full truth,” the
 guardian murmurs, its voice like wind through stone. “Still… I sense no malice in your heart. You walk the edge of shadow and light, warrior. Speak clearly—what is it
 you truly seek?””</i></p>
			
			<p>It seems the deception wasn’t fully successful, but your peaceful intentions may have
 earned you a second chance. You may now try:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Persuasion,</b> if Brulgwyn wants to open up and appeal to the guardian’s
 compassion.</li><br>
				<li> <b>Insight,</b> to try and better understand the spirit’s motivations.</li><br>
				<li> Or you can say something directly to the guardian.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Brulgwyn’s voice falters as he tries to speak earnestly to the spirit. The words catch
 awkwardly in his throat, and his usual warrior’s confidence seems to waver beneath
 the pressure of the moment. Perhaps it's the weight of the journey… or the realization
 of how much is truly at stake.</p>
			
			<p> The spirit’s expression dims, its form growing distant—cold, like frost forming over
 ancient stone.</p>
			
			<p><i> ““Your heart is heavy, but your voice is uncertain,” the guardian intones. “A cure
 cannot be granted on uncertain intentions alone. You must know your purpose…
 and stand by it.””</i></p>
			
			<p>The chamber grows quieter. The path is not closed, but the spirit clearly will not help
 unless Brulgwyn can prove his resolve in another way.</p>
			
			<p> You now have a few options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Attempt a new approach</b> (perhaps a skill like Religion, Insight, or something
 else).</li><br>
				<li><b>Speak your personal vow again,</b> directly from the heart.</li><br>
				<li> <b>Wait and reflect,</b> possibly setting up a rest or seeking a sign.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
	<p><i> Brulgwyn "speak  with his personal vow" Oh!!! ancient 
guardian i came form a long journey  to save my 
people, i hope and the  salvation of my village. I'm  a 
retired warrior who seek peace for my  people, 
happiness to all.</i></p>

			<h1>CHAPTER 13</h1>
			<h2>The Chamber</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn steadies his breath, torchlight flickering against the ancient stone walls as
 he steps away from the glowing vial—for now. Though the trial has ended, the
 chamber still hums with a lingering energy, old and layered like the rings of a deep
rooted tree.</p>
			<p> You scan the chamber with a careful eye.</p>
			<p> &#128367; <b>With your past Perception and Investigation successes</b> (19 and 20
 respectively), you notice:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Engravings</b> along the chamber walls now glow faintly in response to the Root's
 destruction. They depict a <b>ritual—</b>a circle of dwarves holding aloft crystals similar
 in shape to the Root, each surrounded by a halo of divine energy. At the center
 stands a figure robed in light, bearing the amulet of Thramdor, very similar to your
 own.</li><br>
				<li>In a<b> recess near the altar,</b> you uncover a <b>small, locked stone compartment.</b>
 The lock appears mechanical, not magical.</li><br>
				
				<li> Near the collapsed section of wall to the east, <b>a wind stirs faintly</b> from behind
 the stones—hinting at another <b>hidden path or chamber.</b></li><br>
				
				<li>The <b>pillar at the center of the chamber</b> has grooves shaped for placing a
 weapon—likely ceremonial, suggesting this room once served as a temple, or trial
 hall, for Thramdor's chosen.</li>
				</ul>
			<p> Brulgwyn narrows his eyes at the locked stone compartment near the altar. Its ancient
 mechanism shows signs of wear, but the lock is still intact. He kneels down, steadying
 his calloused fingers and reaching into his pouch for a set of basic tools—rudimentary,
 but serviceable.</p>
			
			<p>With a quiet click, Brulgwyn's steady hands manage to shift the ancient locking
 mechanism. The stone compartment grinds open just enough to reveal its contents: a
 small, dust-covered satchel embroidered with faded dwarven runes and a sealed vial
 filled with swirling silvery-blue liquid. The air smells faintly of lavender and ozone.</p>
			<p> Inside the satchel, Brulgwyn finds:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b> A Dwarven Prayer Bead</b> (grants +1 to Wisdom saving throws when worn)</li><br>
				<li><b>The Vial of Aetherbliss</b> (restores 4d4+4 HP and cures one disease or poison
 when consumed)</li>
			</ul>
			<p> There’s also a parchment scroll, brittle with age, detailing a <b>ritual of purification—</b>
 incomplete, but hinting that it can be completed with the knowledge Brulgwyn already</p>
			<p>carries from Lady Vaelora and the amulet of Thramdor.</p>
			
			<p> With a total of <b>15</b> on your <b>Investigation</b> check, Brulgwyn closely examines the
 chamber with a discerning eye.</p>
			<p>He notices that the stone walls are covered in faint carvings—most worn down by
 time, but still legible to a careful observer. These carvings depict dwarves kneeling
 around a glowing root-like structure, with spectral shapes hovering above them.
 Toward the far end of the chamber, Brulgwyn finds a cracked floor tile slightly
 misaligned with the others. Beneath it lies a shallow compartment containing:</p>
			<ul>
			<li> A <b>fragment of ancient parchment,</b> etched with runes similar to those on the
 Root of Withering.</li><br>
				<li> A small <b>vial of silvery liquid,</b> faintly shimmering in the torchlight—perhaps a
 potion or ritual component.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>It seems this hidden cache was part of a forgotten cleansing rite... but it may need
 more to complete.</p>
			<p> Brulgwyn carefully retrieves the <b>parchment</b> and <b>vial,</b> examining them with reverence
 and focus.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>&#x1f4dc;The Ancient Parchment</h3>
			<p>The parchment is brittle but intact, inscribed with flowing <b>dwarvish runes</b> and sacred
 symbols. As Brulgwyn deciphers what he can, he realizes it is part of a <b>cleansing
 incantation—</b>a ritual meant to <b>bind and suppress dark corruption</b> from sacred
 roots.</p>
			<p> Key phrases include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“By oath and flame, purge the shadow’s stain.”</li><br>
				<li> “Let the heart of stone bear the burden of light.”</li><br>
				<li> “When root and spirit align, redemption shall bloom.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The ritual seems to require:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Root of Withering</li><br>
				<li> A cleansing agent (possibly the vial)</li><br>
				<li>A divine vow or "oathbound purpose"</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>&#x1f9ea;The Vial of Silvery Liquid</h3>
		<p>As Brulgwyn unseals the vial and sniffs it cautiously, he detects a faint mix of <b>sacred
 herbs, blessed oil,</b> and possibly <b>moon-touched silver.</b> This is no ordinary potion—
 it appears to be a <b>distilled purifying essence,</b> likely meant to <b>counteract spiritual
 or necrotic corruption.</b></p>
			<p>When combined with the Root and the incantation, this could form a <b>ritual of
 sanctification—</b>but only if performed with conviction and the proper words.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Very wise—Brulgwyn takes a moment to assess the <b>vial’s contents</b> more deeply and
 ensure it's safe and effective for ritual use. Let’s see how the roll plays out.</p>
			
		<p>With a <b>Medicine check of 16,</b> Brulgwyn carefully examines the vial's contents. He
 uncorks it slightly, letting a faint, silvery mist waft up—tinged with a subtle herbal
 scent. His experience with both battlefield wounds and herbal remedies tells him this
 is <b>not a typical potion.</b> It’s alchemically refined and likely safe, but its magic is
 unstable.</p>
			<p> You deduce:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> It’s <b>a restorative elixir,</b> possibly tied to cleansing or resistance.</li><br>
				<li> The instability suggests it should be <b>used during a ritual or in a sacred place,</b>
 rather than drunk casually.</li><br>
				<li> There's a faint resonance with the Root of Withering, almost as if this vial was
 designed to counterbalance its corruption.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> The <b>engraved band</b> around the vial reads:</p>
			<p><i> ““By flame and stone, let rot be undone.””</i></p>
			<p>This could be a <b>verbal component</b> for activating it.</p>
			
			<p>Brulgwyn kneels before the altar, torchlight flickering across the ancient stone as he
 sets the vial gently at its center. He places the <b>Root of Withering</b> beside it—still dark
 and pulsing faintly with cursed energy. The engraved words echo in his memory:</p>
			
			<p><i>““By flame and stone, let rot be undone.””</i></p>
		<p> He grips the <b>amulet of Thramdor</b> and begins the ritual.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3> [Ritual Scene — Skill Check Required]</h3>
			<p> To perform the ritual, Brulgwyn must draw on <b>three forces:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>His connection to divine protection <b>(Religion)</b></li><br>
				<li>His understanding of the corrupted artifact <b>(Arcana)</b></li><br>
				<li>His physical steadiness to complete the rite without mistake <b>(Constitution
 Saving Throw)</b></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Brulgwyn's Ritual Attempt</h3>
			<p>The scene is intense, and the ritual requires both mental and physical endurance.
 Here’s how the rolls affect the outcome:</p>
			<hr>
			<lo>
				<li><b>Religion (2 + 0 = 2)</b>
 Brulgwyn’s call to Thramdor falters. His heart feels heavy, and the divine energy
 he's trying to invoke slips through his grasp, like water through his fingers. The
 connection to the gods feels distant, and the weight of his mission brings doubt
 into his heart. The amulet of Thramdor pulses weakly, but the divine light is not as
 strong as it should be.</li><br>
				
				<li><b>Arcana (15 + 0 = 15)</b>
 Brulgwyn gains insight into the <b>magical nature</b> of the Root of Withering. He
 realizes that while he’s successful in attempting to harness the energies of the
 vial, the potion itself is far more delicate than he anticipated. It's unstable and
 volatile, so any incorrect use could make things worse. However, he understands
 enough to proceed cautiously with the rite.</li><br>
				
				<li><b>Wisdom Saving Throw (3 + 1 = 4)</b>
 As Brulgwyn attempts to endure the strain of the ritual, a wave of <b>psychic
 pressure</b> overwhelms him. His mind aches as he struggles to concentrate on both
 the ritual and the heavy burden of saving his village. The world seems to <b>shrink,</b>
 and his resolve falters under the immense weight of the curse. The pressure of the
 ritual causes him to stumble and lose focus.</li>
			</lo>
			<hr>
			
			<h3>Consequences:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The ritual is <b>partially successful,</b> but not without consequence.</li><br>
				<li> The <b>vial’s energy</b> reacts to the Root of Withering, but the lack of divine strength
 causes the curse to shift into <b>a more unstable state.</b></li><br>
				<li> Brulgwyn feels a <b>wave of exhaustion</b> and <b>mental fog,</b> but he has <b>bought
 himself some time</b> in the process. The room grows colder, the air heavier, as the
 lingering curse tries to reclaim what was undone.</li>
			</ul>

	<h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
	<h2>The Shifting Shadows</h2>
</header>
	<main>
	
	<hr>
		<p>The shifting shadows around him aren’t just formless shapes—they seem to be
 forming into specific images. One shadow takes the shape of his <b>village,</b> its streets
 empty and desolate, with sickened villagers stumbling about. Another shifts into the
 form of a <b>creature,</b> a twisted, monstrous version of something he might have once
 known.</p>
 
		<p>The green flame flickers in the brazier, and it’s clear that these images are connected
 to Brulgwyn’s past and fears. They’re manifesting his deepest anxieties, specifically
 the fear of losing his village, his people, and his sense of duty.</p>
 
		<p>Eldrin’s voice echoes again. “What will you do when your greatest fear confronts you?
 Will you run, or will you face it head-on?”</p>
		
		<p>With a <b>17</b> on your Religion check, Brulgwyn senses that the trial is deeply rooted in
 <b>spiritual</b> and arcane forces. This is not just an illusion—there is something <b>ancient</b>
 at work here. The green flame in the brazier is a conduit, channeling <b>eldritch magic,</b>
 likely tied to an old druidic or fey power.</p>
 
		<p>The shadows forming around him are more than just figments of his mind. They are
 <b>manifestations of his fears,</b> shaped by whatever force governs this trial. However,
 with his knowledge of religious and mystical rites, Brulgwyn realizes something
 crucial.</p>
		<p>This test is <b>not about strength alone</b>. It is about <b>acceptance—</b>facing his fears, not
 simply fighting them. If he only relies on his wooden hammer, he may fail. But if he <b>acknowledges
 and endures</b> the fear, he may overcome the trial.</p>
		
		<p>Brulgwyn plants his feet firmly on the ground, gripping the handle of his wooden hammer but not
 raising it. He takes a deep breath, steadying himself as the <b>shadowy visions swirl
 around him—</b>his village in ruin, his people suffering, and the <b>twisted creature</b>
 lurking at the edge of the dark.</p>
 
	<p>He does not flinch.</p>
 
	<p>The <b>desperate cries of his people</b> echo in his ears, their hollow eyes pleading for
 salvation. The <b>monster snarls,</b> its form writhing with unnatural energy, waiting to
 pounce. But Brulgwyn does not run, nor does he strike.</p>
 
		<p>Instead, he <b>accepts</b> what he sees.</p>
 
		<p>His people <b>need him,</b> but fear will not save them. The creature is <b>a reflection of his
 doubts,</b> not an enemy he must kill. Brulgwyn steadies his heart, knowing that no
 warrior wins every battle through steel alone.</p>
		
		<p>The moment he makes peace with his fear, the <b>shadows tremble—</b>and then <b>begin
 to dissolve</b>. The village fades into mist. The monstrous creature lets out one final,
 haunting growl before <b>vanishing into the ether</b>.</p>
 <p>Silence.</p>
 
		<p>The <b>green flame</b> in the brazier flares one last time before dimming.</p>
 <p>Eldrin Thornbrew steps forward, nodding approvingly. “You understand now.” His voice
 carries a hint of respect. “Courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face it.”</p>
 
		<p>He gestures toward Brulgwyn. “You have passed the trial. And so, I will help you.”</p>
 
		<p>Brulgwyn has <b>overcome his fears</b> and earned Eldrin’s aid.</p>
		
		<p>Brulgwyn straightens himself, the weight of the trial still settling in his mind. He looks
 Eldrin in the eye and gives a firm nod.</p>
 
		<p>“I thank ye for this trial,” he says, his voice steady. “I see now that strength alone
 won’t be enough to save my people. I’ll remember this.”</p>
		<p>Eldrin watches him for a moment, then gives a slow nod of approval. “Gratitude is a
 rare thing among warriors. Many would curse the test instead of learning from it.” His
 lips curl into the faintest smirk. “You may yet have the wisdom to succeed in your
 quest.”</p>
 
		<p>He turns toward the brazier and waves a hand over the embers. The green flame
 flickers once more, and a faint <b>golden glow</b> shimmers in the air.</p>
 
		<p>“Come,” he says. “You have earned my aid, and I will tell you what you seek.”</p>
 
		<p>Brulgwyn follows as Eldrin steps beyond the altar and toward a <b>small wooden hut</b>
 hidden in the trees. Inside, <b>shelves lined with ancient tomes, dried herbs, and
 strange trinkets</b> fill the space with the scent of earth and time itself. Eldrin gestures
 for him to sit.</p>
 
		<p>“The flu that plagues your people…” Eldrin murmurs, pulling a worn <b>leather-bound
 book</b> from the shelf. “It is no ordinary sickness.” He places the book before Brulgwyn
 and flips it open. The pages reveal <b>drawings of withered bodies, dark veins
 twisting like roots beneath their skin.</b></p>
		
		<img src="old book1_01.jpg" alt="old book" width="1187" height="698">
		
		<p> “This illness,” Eldrin continues, “is not a disease of nature. It is a curse.”</p>
		
		<p> The words hang heavy in the air.</p>
		
		<p>With a <b>5</b> on Insight, Brulgwyn struggles to read Eldrin’s expression. The old mystic’s
 face remains unreadable, his tone calm and steady. There’s no clear sign of deceit, but
 Brulgwyn can’t tell if Eldrin is holding anything back or if the word <b>"curse"</b> carries
 more weight than it seems.</p>
		
		<p>One thing is certain—the drawings in the book <b>bear an eerie resemblance</b> to what
 Brulgwyn saw in his village. The darkened veins, the weakness in his people… it
 matches what Eldrin describes. Whether he fully trusts the man or not, there’s a
 strong chance <b>he knows something valuable</b>.</p>

			<h1>CHAPTER 9</h1>
			<h2>Inside The Black Hollow</h2>
			</header>
		<mian>
			
			<hr>
		<p> The moment he crosses the threshold, the air grows <b>heavy and still.</b> Sound seems
 swallowed—the clang of his boots on stone muffled, his breath faint like smoke in a
 storm.</p>
			<p> The tunnel opens into a wide, ruined chamber—once a <b>grand hall,</b> now crumbled and
 dark. Broken tables and rusted armor lie scattered across the floor. Cracks in the walls
 pulse faintly with a sickly green glow, like <b>veins feeding something unseen.</b></p>
			<p>At the center stands a <b>stone pedestal,</b> shattered. Around it, the floor bears ancient
 carvings of roots twisting into dwarven runes—some scratched out, others warped.</p>
			<p> Suddenly… a whisper echoes—not in the air, but <b>in Brulgwyn’s mind:</b></p>
			<i><p> ““You seek what was buried… will you bleed to reach it?””</p></i>
			<p>Brulgwyn’s grip tightens on his warhammer. The Hollow is aware.</p>
			<p>With a <b>9,</b> Brulgwyn narrows his eyes at the glowing runes, the pedestal, and the
 twisted root-like carvings. The aura here is <b>clearly magical,</b> but the exact purpose or
 nature of it escapes him. However, a few things are clear:</p>
			<lo>
				<li>The green glow isn't natural—it's necrotic magic, or something closely tied to
 decay and corruption.</li>
				<li>The runes were once protective wards, likely etched by dwarven hands long
 ago... but something has warped or reversed them.</li>
				<li>The pedestal may have once held an object of power—now shattered.</li>
				</lo>
			<p>Then—he hears it again. A whisper. Louder. Clearer.</p>
			<p><i> ““One must feed the roots… to reach their heart.””</i></p>
			<p> As those words crawl through his thoughts, the carvings around the pedestal <b>pulse
 faintly,</b> almost like they’re reacting to his presence.</p>
			<p><b>Brulgwyn uses his final Elixir of Warding Shadows.</b> 
 Its silvery liquid shimmers as he drinks it—cool as ice, but burning with energy that
 rushes through his veins.</p>
			<img src="postion_01.jpg" alt="postion" width="1169" height="680">
			<p> For the next hour, Brulgwyn is wreathed in a faint, protective aura. Shadows seem to
 <b>bend around him,</b> and darker magics recoil ever so slightly from his presence.</p>
			<p><i><b>“Effect Active:</b> Grants advantage on saving throws vs. necrotic, illusion, and fear
 effects for 1 hour.</i></p>
			<p>As the elixir takes hold, the carvings around the pedestal <b>flare brighter,</b> the whisper
 returning with a shiver of cold wind through the ruined hall:</p>
			<i><p>““You carry the Last Light… but the Hollow is deep.””</p></i>
			<p>The room goes still. Then, a distant sound—like <b>stone grinding</b> far below.</p>
			<p>Somewhere beneath you, a path has opened.</p>
			<p><b>(18 + 1 = 19) —</b> A sharp roll! Brulgwyn’s warrior instincts are as keen as ever.</p>
				<p>As he steadies his breath and listens, the faint grinding sound echoes again—and this
 time, he spots it:</p>
	<p>Near the <b>northern wall,</b> behind a collapsed archway, a section of the floor has
 <b>shifted downward,</b> revealing a narrow spiral stair carved from old stone. The
 carvings near the pedestal dim again, almost like they’ve served their purpose.</p>
			<p> The stairwell winds <b>deep beneath the ruined hall,</b> where no torchlight reaches.</p>
			<p> A faint, earthy scent rises<b>—old roots, damp earth,</b> and <b>something… wrong.</b> It
 feels like the Hollow is <b>inviting</b> him down.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn lights a torch, the flame casting flickering shadows across the crumbling
 hall. The warmth of the fire contrasts with the chill in the air, a quiet warning of the
 unknown depths ahead.</p>
			<p>He steps toward the spiral stair, the scent of damp earth growing stronger as he
 descends. The stairwell is narrow, carved into the <b>stone bedrock</b> of the mountain,</p>
			<p>winding down in slow, deliberate turns. The air grows heavier the further he goes,
 f
 illed with the sound of <b>dripping water</b> and distant, unsettling <b>whispers.</b></p>
			<p>The light from the torch reveals strange markings on the walls—almost like <b>roots,</b>
 twisting in spirals and knotting into shapes that look disturbingly like faces. Faces that
 seem to watch as he moves.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>At the bottom of the stairwell, the tunnel opens into a <b>wide chamber,</b> the ceiling so
 high it’s almost swallowed by darkness. In the center of the room, a <b>stone altar</b>
 stands, its surface covered in ancient <b>moss</b> and <b>roots</b> that seem to pulse with a faint,
 eerie glow.</p>
			<p> At the altar’s base, a <b>large stone door—</b>seemingly untouched by time—looms, its
 surface covered in faded symbols. The symbols seem to <b>shift</b> as the torchlight
 f
 lickers, forming new runes.</p>
			<p> But something doesn’t feel right. There’s an oppressive energy here. <b>The Hollow
 Heart</b> may be closer than ever.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn cautiously steps forward, his torchlight flickering as he approaches the
 <b>stone altar</b>. The <b>roots</b> and <b>moss</b> that cling to it pulse faintly, almost like the
 heartbeat of the Hollow itself. His senses heighten as he examines the altar and the
 stone door that stands before him.</p>
			<p>The <b>altar</b> is ancient, carved with intricate patterns—dwarven runes interwoven with
 symbols of decay and growth. It seems to be both a <b>sacred offering place</b> and a
 <b>corrupting force,</b> built in reverence to something powerful and dark.</p>
			<p>The <b>stone door,</b> however, stands out. It’s nearly flawless, despite its age. The surface
 is smooth, covered in <b>shifting symbols</b> that change with each flicker of the
 torchlight, as if reacting to Brulgwyn’s presence. The air around it feels <b>charged,</b> thick
 with untold magic.</p>
			<p>With a <b>5,</b> the symbols on the door remain cryptic and elusive, their meaning just
 beyond Brulgwyn's understanding. While he recognizes some of the dwarven script
 and symbols, they seem <b>distorted,</b> almost as if corrupted by time or dark magic.</p>
			<p>The words appear to be both <b>ancient</b> and <b>foreign,</b> too twisted for him to decipher
 fully. The more he looks, the more the symbols seem to shift, making his head ache
 slightly.</p>
			<p>However, he does pick up one fragment of a word among the tangled runes: <i>"Root".</i></p>
			<hr>
			<p><b>Natural 20!</b> Brulgwyn’s eyes scan the altar with the precision of a seasoned
 warrior driven by purpose—and this time, the Hollow <b>cannot hide its secrets.</b></p>
			<p>As he kneels and brushes aside some of the moss, his hand grazes a <b>carved root pattern</b> unlike the others. Pressing it, there's a faint <b>click,</b> and part of the altar
 <b>shifts,</b> revealing a <b>hidden recess.</b></p>
			<p>Inside lies a <b>small stone carving</b> shaped like a twisted tree—its roots entangled
 around a gemstone shaped like a <b>heart.</b> The roots pulse with the same eerie glow as
 the ones around the altar. More importantly, carved along its base are <b>clear,
 untwisting runes,</b> readable now:</p>
			<p><b><i>“"To pass into the Hollow Heart, bear the Root and speak the Promise."”</i></b></p>
			<p>As Brulgwyn takes the carving, the stone door begins to <b>vibrate softly,</b> symbols
 pausing their shifting for a moment—as if <b>waiting.</b></p>
			<hr>
			<p>With a <b>3,</b> Brulgwyn furrows his brow, reaching into his memories for any dwarven rite
 or ancestral vow... but all he finds are fragments<b>—hymns half-remembered, oaths
 whispered in stone halls,</b> and echoes of words long lost.</p>
			<p>The phrase <b>“Speak the Promise”</b> remains unclear. He knows it's important, maybe
 tied to some kind of <b>sacred vow or personal oath,</b> but its exact form escapes him.
 Still, as he grips the stone carving of the <b>Root,</b> a strange certainty fills his heart—not
 from knowledge, but from his <b>conviction.</b></p>
			<p> He remembers his people. Their faces. The sound of their coughing. The fading
 warmth of the forge fires. Their hope now rests with him.</p>
			<p> And perhaps… <i>that</i> is the promise.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Though the religious meaning eluded you, you sensed something deeper—your
 <b>personal vow</b> to save your village may be the key</p>
			<p> The stone door before you stands still, runes pulsing faintly, as though waiting for your
 next action.</p>

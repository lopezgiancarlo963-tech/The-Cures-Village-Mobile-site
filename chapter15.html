				<hr>
				<p> As Brulgwyn speaks those powerful words, the hammer atop the pedestal trembles
 ever so slightly. The carved stone of the statue seems to resonate with his declaration,
 the ancient runes glowing brighter.</p>
				<p> For a moment, there is silence. Then, the hammer lifts from its resting place, floating
 in the air before gently settling into Brulgwyn's hands. The weight of it feels
 substantial, but not burdensome—a symbol of his unwavering loyalty and purpose.</p>
				<p> The voice speaks again, this time softer, but full of respect:</p>
				<p><b> "The Hammer of Loyalty has chosen you. Your path is heavy, but you carry it
 with conviction. The strength to fulfill your promise will guide your hands.
 Keep it close."</b></p>
				<p> Brulgwyn now holds the Hammer of Loyalty, a weapon imbued with the resolve to
 fulfill his promises and the strength of his heart’s intent. Its magical aura hums with
 the power of dedication and duty.The next challenge awaits. Will Brulgwyn approach the next relic? Or will he take a
 moment to reflect?</p>
				
				<p>Brulgwyn steps forward, his grip tightening on the Hammer of Loyalty as he
 approaches the next relic. The room seems to grow quieter, the air heavier with
 anticipation.</p>
				<p> This time, the relic he faces is a <b>shield—</b>ornate and glowing, suspended in midair. The
 shield is carved with intricate designs, but one stands out: an image of a mother
 cradling a child, surrounded by protective hands. The shield radiates an aura of
 protection and guardianship.</p>
				
				<img src="shield_01.jpg" alt="sheild" width="648" height="649" >
			
				<p> As Brulgwyn approaches, the voice echoes through the chamber again:</p>
				<p><b> "The Shield of Protection awaits one who defends not just with might, but
 with heart. Are you a guardian? A protector of those who cannot protect
 themselves? If you seek the strength to defend, approach with the same
 resolve."</b></p>
				<p> The shield hovers before him, offering its power, but only if Brulgwyn proves his worth
 as a protector.</p>
				<p> Will Brulgwyn choose to take the Shield of Protection? Or does he feel he must
 continue with his quest without it?</p>
				<p>Brulgwyn steps forward, his hand extending toward the Shield of Protection. The
 moment his fingers graze the shield's surface, a warm, radiant energy pulses through
 him. It feels as though the shield recognizes the warrior's heart and his resolve to
 protect those he holds dear—his village, his people, and his promise.</p>
				<p>The glowing shield settles into Brulgwyn's hands, its ornate carvings shimmering with
 a newfound brilliance. The image of the mother and child glows brighter, as if
 acknowledging Brulgwyn's dedication to protecting those who cannot defend
 themselves. The weight of the shield feels natural, fitting perfectly with his grip.</p>
				<p> As Brulgwyn holds the shield, the voice resounds one final time:</p>
				<p><b> "You are a true protector, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. With this shield, you
 shall defend what is precious to you, and may its strength help guide you on
 your quest. The Shield of Protection will stand as a beacon in the darkest of
 times."</b></p>
				<p> The chamber seems to calm, the other relics becoming still as Brulgwyn now holds
 both the Hammer of Loyalty and the Shield of Protection. A powerful energy courses
 through him, reinforcing his purpose and his commitment to his people.</p>
				<p> The voice fades, leaving Brulgwyn in the silence of the chamber, but with a renewed
 sense of determination and power.</p>
	<p>Brulgwyn finds a quiet corner of the chamber, away from the relics, and sets down his
 newly acquired shield and hammer. He carefully rests them beside him, feeling the weight of the responsibility they carry. The air in the chamber is thick with ancient
 magic, yet there’s a strange calm that settles over him.</p>
				
				<p>As he sits, he focuses on steadying his breath and allowing his mind to relax. The
 weariness from the journey, the trials, and the emotional strain of his mission slowly
 begin to ease. The soft hum of the magic in the room wraps around him like a
 comforting blanket, helping him regain his strength.</p>
				
				<p>After some time, he feels his body relax and his energy slowly return. The lingering
 exhaustion from his previous trials and the stress of his mission begin to dissipate,
 though the weight of his purpose remains.</p>
				<p> He now feels ready to continue forward, but he knows the next step of his journey will
 be just as dangerous and filled with unknowns. The chamber, with its relics and its
 quiet reverence, has provided him with both physical rest and renewed purpose.</p>
				<p>With his strength renewed, Brulgwyn gathers his weapons and shield, the weight of
 the ancient relics now a comforting presence at his side. The mysterious chamber
 behind him, with its echoes of forgotten power, feels like a distant memory as he
 steps forward, his resolve firmer than ever.</p>
				<p>The path ahead is unclear, but Brulgwyn knows the way forward is the only option. He
 adjusts the grip on his hammer, the shield resting securely on his back, and steps out
 into the darkness, the only sound the faint crackle of energy in the air and his boots
 echoing softly on the stone floor.</p>
				<p> As he proceeds, the way forward seems to twist and turn with a haunting, labyrinthine
 quality, as if the very walls themselves are shifting, testing his will. But his mind is focused on the task at hand—to save his people and fulfill the promise he made.</p>
				<p> The air grows colder the deeper he goes, and soon, a faint glow begins to illuminate
 the passage ahead. Brulgwyn can sense that he is nearing something... powerful.</p>
				
				<p>With a roll of 20, Brulgwyn moves through the area with exceptional stealth, making
 no sound and leaving no trace of his passage. He’s able to navigate through the
 cavern undetected, slipping past any potential threats.</p>
				
				<p> As Brulgwyn continues, the air grows heavier, and the whispers from earlier seem to
 return, echoing softly in the distance. The deeper he goes, the more the sense of
 being watched grows. But, with his skillful movements, he remains hidden from any
 prying eyes.</p>
				<p> With your roll of 19 on Sleight of Hand, Brulgwyn deftly maneuvers through the hidden
 paths, using his nimbleness to avoid any detection. As you make your way through the
 ancient chambers, you manage to subtly adjust a few of the relics in place, leaving no
 trace of your movements.</p>
				<p>You feel confident that you have not disturbed anything that could trigger a trap or
 alert any watchful guardians of the Hollow. Your quiet and steady progress allows you
 to proceed with minimal risk.</p>
				
				<p> As Brulgwyn moves deeper into the Hollow, the air grows colder, and the stone
 beneath his boots becomes slick with age. The faint echo of his footsteps fills the
 silence of the abandoned ruins, and the distant hum of magic seems to grow stronger.</p>
				
				<p> The deeper you go, the more oppressive the atmosphere feels, as if the very walls are
 watching you, holding onto the secrets of the past. The path begins to narrow, and the
 once smooth walls of the Hollow are now jagged, adorned with strange runes that
 seem to shimmer faintly in the dim light.</p>
				
				<p>After a few moments of cautious movement, you come to a fork in the path. One route
 seems to lead downward, into what could be an ancient chamber, while the other path
 leads deeper into the heart of the Hollow, where the air feels charged with energy.</p>
				
				<p>Brulgwyn takes a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision as he turns toward
 the path leading deeper into the heart of the Hollow. The air feels thick with power,
 and the eerie silence presses in on him from all sides. As he proceeds, the walls grow
 even more ancient, the runes more cryptic, glowing faintly in a language he does not
 understand.</p>
				
			<p> The further he moves, the more oppressive the atmosphere becomes, as if the very
 essence of the Hollow is alive, watching him, perhaps even testing him. The stone
 beneath his boots becomes slicker, and the air feels colder with each step, like the
 heart of the Hollow itself is drawing closer.</p>
				
				<p>After a short while, Brulgwyn rounds a corner and sees an imposing door. It is carved
 with intricate runes and adorned with symbols of protection and warding. At the
 center is a large circular pattern, which seems to pulse with energy. The door looks
 old, but it emanates a feeling of deep power.</p>
				
				<p>As Brulgwyn approaches the door, a voice—soft and ancient—whispers in his mind,
 "Do you seek the cure, child of stone?"</p>
				
				<p> With a roll of 4, Brulgwyn doesn't feel quite confident in reading the situation. The
 area around him feels charged with ancient energy, and the path ahead is still unclear.
 He senses that something important lies ahead but struggles to discern the deeper
 meaning.</p>
				
			<p>Brulgwyn, fortified by the Shield of Protection, feels a renewed sense of strength and
 resilience. The shield’s energy hums as he grips it tightly, his resolve hardening as he
 presses on through the eerie, winding path.</p>
				
				<p>The air grows colder, and the shadows seem to dance at the edge of his vision, but
 with the shield's protection, Brulgwyn feels a sense of security that he didn't have
 before. The way ahead is dark, but the shield's magic grants him an otherworldly
 sense of safety, and he continues down the path with renewed determination.</p>
				
				<p> As he moves forward, the oppressive silence seems to intensify, broken only by the
 soft echo of his footsteps. He doesn't know exactly what lies ahead, but he knows this
 is the right direction—he’s one step closer to uncovering the cure for his village.</p>
				
				<p> Would you like to proceed down the path, or would you like to do something else (such
 as performing another skill check, investigating your surroundings, or preparing for
 potential danger)?</p>
				
				<p>With a total of <b>17 on your Investigation check,</b> Brulgwyn scans the ancient,
 winding corridor of the Heart of the Hollow with a sharp eye.</p>
				
				<p> The walls are etched with faded dwarven carvings—some speak of oaths made in
 blood, others of a sacred forge that once burned in the deep. Near the base of one
 wall, hidden behind old rubble, Brulgwyn uncovers <b>a narrow side tunnel</b> just large
 enough for him to squeeze through. Within, he finds a <b>sealed stone coffer</b> adorned
 with the emblem of Thramdor—the same divine symbol as his amulet.</p>
				
		<p> It’s locked with a complex mechanism, but Brulgwyn notices it has <b>runic slots</b> that
 match the pattern glowing faintly on the Root carving he used earlier...</p>
				
	<p>Would you like to try opening the coffer, or continue onward down the main tunnel?</p>
